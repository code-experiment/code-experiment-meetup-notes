# Code Experiment Meeting 009 September 9, 2020

# * UPDATE *
- QA at the point is starting the Javascript Cypress training again but the day and time has been moved to Wednesday instead of Tuesday.  We will be moving Code Experiment meetup to Tuesdays at 6:00 pm, so we can attend the Cypress training.  I originally chose Wednesday to not conflict with the Tuesday cypress training that was on hold because of COVID but the teacher needed to change the time and obviously we're flexible since we're small.
