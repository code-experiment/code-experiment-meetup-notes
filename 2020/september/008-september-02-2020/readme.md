# Code Experiment Meeting 008 September 02, 2020

- New member Rixio was the only one that showed up.  Instead of continuing with the course I helped him with some of the previous portions of FreeCodeCamp.


- **Homework**
  - Please continue working through the Responsive Web Design Certification if you haven't finished that yet.
    - Please show off your finished work in the slack channel
  - Once you finish the web design certification, please start working through the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
    - Please don't work on the following as we will do these in class:
      - The 5 Final Projects
      - All Basic Algorithm Scripting
      - All Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
  - Since we didn't get to work on the challenges this week, we will start next week with `Truncate a String`.  We got up to and finished `Repeat a String Repeat a String` in the `Basic Algorithm Scripting` last week.
