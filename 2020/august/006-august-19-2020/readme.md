# Code Experiment Meeting 004 August 5th, 2020

## Agenda
- **Welcome any new people**
  - Have them introduce themselves
    - Name and location?
    - How long have you been coding?
    - Goals?


- **Review things finished on website**
  - Random Winner (Brian)
    - Work in progress


- **Show And Tell**
  - Show off last weeks Technical Documentation Pages
    - Last week we had Danielle, Daniel and Michael so we split off and went solo and gave tips as we came across them.
    - We all got stuck with the sidebar, it will be nice to see what everyone finished up with during the week.  The main thing that got mine working was `overflow: auto` and `height` for my links wrapper being less then `100%`.
    - Here is Daniel's finished project.  [View Here](https://codepen.io/gleekzorp/full/QWNEgYw)
  - Talk about anything new that anyone learned this week


- **Todays Challenge**
  - FreeCodeCamp Design Certificate
    - Personal Portfolio Page
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage
  - We only had Danielle and Daniel.  We worked through the HTML together and we will work through the CSS on our own throughout the week.


- **Homework**
  - Please make sure to have your Personal Portfolio Page finished to show off at the next meetup.
  - Please continue working through FreeCodeCamps Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Section as we start this NEXT WEEK!
    - I initially thought we would only work through the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting and Project Sections as a team.  As I have been finishing this certification I realized we will be doing a lot more of this as a team then just those two sections.  There is some technical information in here that I think would be good for everyone to review together.
