# Code Experiment Meeting 039 April 06, 2021

## Agenda
- **Welcome any new people**
  - Have them introduce themselves
    - Name and location?
    - How long have you been coding?
    - Goals?


- **Todays Challenge**
  - Todo App with FastAPI


- **Homework**
  - Research more FastAPI!  Remember the way I learned how to do all of this was going through some tutorials and then I went and built out a project on my own with the new knowledge to reinforce it.  Now I'm teaching the class what I learned which is reinforcing it even further.
