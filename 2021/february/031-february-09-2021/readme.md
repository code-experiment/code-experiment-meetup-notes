# Code Experiment Meeting 031 February 09, 2021

## Agenda
- **Welcome any new people**
  - Have them introduce themselves
    - Name and location?
    - How long have you been coding?
    - Goals?


- **Show And Tell**
  - Show off our `25 + 5 Clocks`


- **Todays Challenge**
  - We need to decide on our next project.  We decided to continue with freeCodeCamp.
  - Since it was just Michael and Daniel, we decided to work on some of the `code-experiment` website bugs.  We fixed a dependency issue along with fixing the contact form.  We updated the nodemailer to use `oAuth` as it wasn't getting authenticated correctly.


- **Homework**
  - Start working through the `APIs and Microservices` at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/
